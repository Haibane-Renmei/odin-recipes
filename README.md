# odin-recipes
Before starting: This project is to create a recipe website using the skills I have
learned so far during The Odin Project. I imagine I will be creating directories, html files, images, and also using some of the html I have learned such as setting up a document
and also strong, emphasis, imagines, links and almost certainly lists.
