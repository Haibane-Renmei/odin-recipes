        <li>⅓ cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coriander <em>ground</em></li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin <em>ground</em></li>
        <li>2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt <em>or to taste</em></li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic <em>minced</em></li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh ginger <em>minced or paste</em></li>

        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cilantro <em>freshly chopped</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Add the chicken, yogurt, spices, salt, and half of each the garlic 
            and ginger to a large mixing bowl or sealable freezer bag. Mix 
            everything well and transfer to the fridge to marinate for at least 
            1 hour. If using a bowl, cover it with plastic wrap.</li></p>
            <p><li>Melt 2 tbsp of the butter in a deep skillet over medium-high 
                heat. Add the onion, chicken and marinade to the skillet and 
                cook for 5-7 minutes, until the chicken is mostly cooked through. 
                Stir occasionally.</li></p>
            <p><li>Stir in the remaining garlic and ginger. Cook for 30 seconds
                 – 1 minute, or until aromatic. Stir in the passata and heavy 
                 cream, then turn the heat down to a simmer. Cook for 15 minutes, 
                 stirring occasionally. Stir in remaining 2 tbsp butter.</li></p>
                <p><li>Taste for seasoning and garnish with cilantro. Serve over steamed 
                    rice with a side of naan.</li></p>
    </ol>
