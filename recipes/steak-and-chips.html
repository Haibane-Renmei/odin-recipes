   <h4>A classic done exceptionally well, or should we say a rare done exceptionally medium?</h4>
   <p>It doesn't get much more simple than a lovely plate of steak and chips, yet with a few
    expert tweaks and some added care, you can up your game and impress friends and family!
   </p>
    <p>At this recipe site we like our steak medium-rare, but seeing as we think you're
        a pretty nice person, we'll avert our eyes if you choose for something a little more...
        cooked?
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the chips:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large floury potatoes (500g)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the steak:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Rump steaks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt to season steaks</li>
        <li>40 g cubed butter</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves peeled and gently crushed with the flat side of a knife</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Remove steaks from the fridge 1 hour before cooking.
            Preheat the oven to 200°C (fan) (450°F).</li></p>
            <p><li>Leave the skins on the potatoes and slice into chips, around half 
                a cm thick. Place the chips into a bowl and toss in olive oil, 
                salt and pepper. Transfer to a baking tray and bake for 30 minutes 
                or until golden and crisp. Turn half way through.</li></p>
            <p><li>Start to prepare the rump steaks when there is 15 minutes left 
                on the timer for the chips. Place a large griddle pan or frying 
                pan on a high heat. Prep the steak by drizzling both sides with 
                olive oil and salt. Then use your fingers to rub the oil and salt 
                into the meat.</li></p>
                <p><li>Once the pan is hot place the rump steaks in the pan, 
                    they should sizzle immediately. Leave to cook on the first side 
                    for 3-4 minutes.</li></p>
                <p><li>Turn the steak over and add the butter and 2 peeled and crushed garlic 
            cloves. Cook on the second side for 2-3 minutes (rare – medium) and 
            baste with butter and garlic. (Adjust the cooking time according to 
            your preferences - see expert tips below). Once cooked transfer to a 
            chopping board and cover with foil. Allow to rest for 5 minutes. 
            Reserve any excess butter in the pan for drizzling later.</li></p>
            <li>Once rested, slice the steak and serve along the oven 
                roasted chips. Drizzle with the garlic butter.</li>
    </ol>
